Pummel,

A kick butt, take no prisoners, sort of theme, that will get your point across!

To get the most out of Pummel, be sure to set a static front page for home and a blog page for the blog listing page.

Designed to look good on any screen, whether it’s your wide screen monitor, the new Android in your pocket or dare I say it, that smart watch on your wrist! Featuring a sharp looking, easy to customize Front Page, consisting of three distinct sections. The first is accessed from the page editor. The second section consists of two rows of three widgets with the ability to select any background color. The third section is one row of two widgets with a customizable background  same as the top.

The entire site is built with Bootstrap, for a responsive design, allowing all columns and widgets to stack gracefully on smaller screens. For even more content, creation freedom, be sure to add the Bootstrap Shortcodes plugin, which will enable the ability to create columns and rows, buttons, use icons, and everything else Bootstrap has to offer.

But wait, that’s not all…

Head over to the theme customizer and check out the many options available. Change background, font, and accent colors, till you achieve that winning look you’ve been searching for.

[Built off of _S](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) and [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com).
